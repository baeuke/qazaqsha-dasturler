## About

Qazaqsha Dasturler is a web application inspired by the Poolsuite FM website. The goal was to create a "techy" looking website with a design reminiscent of the "System 1" operating system used in old Macintosh computers. While the initial plan was to compile the chronology of all common Kazakh customs, due to time constraints, the focus shifted to rituals related to the birth and upbringing of a child. To accommodate the variations in traditions for boys and girls, the website includes a toggle button for switching between them.

## Features

- **Radio Player:** Users can play/pause, play next, and play previous songs on the radio player. The player is draggable on mouse down for a seamless user experience.

- **Dastur FM Icon:** Once the player is closed, it can be reopened by clicking on the "Dastur FM" radio icon.

- **Fullscreen Mode:** Users can go fullscreen and view the website as a presentation by clicking on the "Fullscreen" button in the upper right corner.

**Note:** This project was developed by Baurzhan and Dilnaz as a part of the nFactorial Incubator Hackathon 2022.
