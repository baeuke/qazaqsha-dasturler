               In Kazakhstan, there has always been a cult of the child in the family, which is reflected in folklore. Kazakhs believe that the house, where there is a child, is bright and happy, and the house without children is like a grave. Children's traditions of the Kazakh people are closely connected with folk beliefs and cults. The rituals performed for girls and boys until they reach the age of 6 are almost identical. Let's see the differences :)

                        To celebrate <span id="shildehana" class="spanP">the birth of a baby,</span> a shildekhana festival is held.
                        <br></br> 
                        It is held on the day when this joyful event occurred. The person who first notified about childbirth receives gifts.
                        <br></br>
                        Relatives, friends, and relatives come to the home of young parents to celebrate the emergence of a new member of the community. They congratulate parents, express wishes to the baby, and in the evening - have fun and enjoy a hearty dinner. The father of the child slaughters the sacrificial lamb and distributes the meat to relatives and friends.

                     <p>
                        - literally meaning <span class="spanP">“coming out of 40 days”;</span> it is celebrated when it is about 40 days since a child was born.
                        <br></br>
                        It is believed that before the end of this period, the baby is too weak and unprotected from the effects of the external environment, and especially - the evil forces. Until the end of forty days a newborn is not shown to strangers.
                        <br></br>
                        However, the day when this happens it is considered the second birthday, and a baby is officially presented to the relatives, and family friends.
                        <br></br>
                        40 days is an approximate term: <span id="qyrqynansh" class="spanP">for a boy, they celebrate it on 37–39th day.

                        A saddle is an extremely important thing for any nomad. Kazakhs taught boys to ride a horse starting from the age of five. On this day, elders blessed the young rider and parents organized a small celebration in honor of their son.
                        <br></br>
                        The child's first encounter with the horse is celebrated as a big event. The child is dressed in new clothes, wears uki (eagle owl feathers that are believed to protect the rider), sits on the saddle decorated with patterns (ashamai). He sets off to visit his relatives. Relatives, in their turn, throw shashu (a rite for abundance) and give various presents to the boy, e.g. various saddle accessories.
